Using `<g>` (group) elements in SVG can indeed provide several benefits, especially when it comes to managing transformations and optimizing your SVG structure. Here are some considerations regarding the use of `<g>` elements and the implications of removing them:

### Benefits of Using `<g>` Elements

1. **Simplified Transformations**:
   - Grouping elements allows you to apply transformations (like translation, rotation, and scaling) to the entire group at once. This can simplify your code and reduce the need for recalculating individual positions.

2. **Organizational Clarity**:
   - `<g>` elements help organize your SVG structure, making it easier to manage and understand the relationships between different shapes.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - While the performance impact may vary, using groups can sometimes lead to better rendering performance, especially if you have many elements. Grouping can reduce the number of individual transformations the browser needs to calculate.

4. **Easier Event Handling**:
   - You can attach event listeners to a group, allowing you to manage interactions for multiple elements without needing to attach listeners to each individual element.

### Considerations for Removing `<g>` Elements

1. **Recalculation of Positions**:
   - If you remove `<g>` elements, you will need to manually manage the positions of each individual shape. This can lead to more complex code, especially if the shapes are frequently updated or transformed.

2. **Increased Complexity**:
   - Without groups, your SVG may become more complex and harder to maintain, as you will need to handle transformations and positioning for each element separately.

3. **Potential for Redundant Code**:
   - You may end up duplicating code for transformations and positioning across multiple elements, which can lead to maintenance challenges.

### Recommendations

- **Keep `<g>` Elements**: If your use case involves multiple shapes that need to be transformed together, it's generally a good idea to keep the `<g>` elements. They provide a clean way to manage transformations and maintain the structure of your SVG.

- **Use Signals Effectively**: Since you mentioned using signals, you can leverage them to update the positions of elements efficiently when needed, even if they are not grouped. However, this may require more careful management of state.

- **Profile Performance**: If performance is a concern, consider profiling your SVG rendering to see if removing `<g>` elements has a significant impact. In many cases, the benefits of grouping outweigh the potential downsides.

In summary, while it is possible to work without `<g>` elements, they offer significant advantages in terms of organization, simplicity, and performance. If your application can benefit from these features, it may be worth keeping them in your SVG structure.
